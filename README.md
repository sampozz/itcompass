# IT Compass Test

## Introduction
The IT Compass Test is inspired by the now famous Political Compass test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Compass) which is today a great source of criticisms and memes. You will simply have to indicate (freely and according to your ideas) how much you agree with 20 propositions about the worlds of information technology, software, networks, internet, social networks, and the latest technologies. There are not right or wrong answers. At the end of the test, you will find the result based on your answers and some guidelines to understand it.
