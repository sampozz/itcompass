    <br><br><h2 class="question-title">And here is a brief explanation</h2>

    <div class="auth-left">
        <b>Auth-left:</b> You do not like the big companies. Wealth must be owned by the government 
        instead of a single rich guy. Work is a fundamental value that must be safeguarded. 
        The evolution of technologies is not your priority, as it could lead to social issues.
    </div>
    <div class="auth-right">
        <b>Auth-right:</b> The idea of upholding strict social hierarchies remains in the Auth. 
        Also, you like the rules, everyone should be controlled by the government to 
        maintain law and order. People should always defend their own nation from external threats. 
    </div>
    <div class="lib-left">
        <b>Lib-left:</b> You believe strongly in workerâ€™s rights, as well as social freedom. 
        The big companies of the web represent a threat, because they own every 
        information of every human being. You always search for innovation, as 
        the totally digital world is your final goal, whatever it takes. 
    </div>
    <div class="lib-right">
        <b>Lib-right:</b> The government should be decentralized and aggressive, 
        unrestrained capitalism should determine social hierarchy. Individual 
        liberty and self-conservation lie at the core of the libertarian right. 
    </div>
