<div class="intro">
    The IT Compass Test is inspired by the now famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Compass">
    Political Compass test</a>, a great source of criticisms and memes. You 
    will simply have to indicate (freely and according to your ideas) how 
    much you agree with 20 propositions about the worlds of information 
    technology, software, networks, internet, social networks, and the 
    latest technologies. There are not right or wrong answers. At the 
    end of the test, you will find the result based on your answers and 
    some guidelines to understand it.

<div class="disclaimer">
    I made this website during my free time as a simple educational project. 
    The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/sampozz/itcompass">GitHub profile</a>. 
    This test is not based on any scientific study and the results do not 
    strictly represent the reality. Please, do not use this website as a 
    penetration testing target: you will just waste my time and will not find anything interesting.
